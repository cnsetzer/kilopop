This package produces kilonovae following the population model presented in Setzer et al. 2022.

For basic usage, see example given in the Tutorial folder.

In order to execute this code the user will need to download and install
lapack 3.8 or higher from https://netlib.org/lapack/#_software.

Once this is done, the user must modify the location of the lapack installation

pip install bnspopkne
"""
