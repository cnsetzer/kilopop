FORTRAN Dependencies
--------------------

This package uses a FORTRAN backend library which generates the luminosity and temperature evolution of
the grey-body kilonova.

In order to use the FORTRAN library the user must install and link :code:`lapack` and :code:`blas`.

The recommended way for doing this is to use the :code:`gfortran` compiler and download and build the :code:`lapack` from source at
`this link <https://netlib.org/lapack/#_previous_release>`_. Proceed by following the provided instructions in the tar file.

Then add the location of the installation of the library to your :code:`$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable. Once this is done,
you can proceed to install via :code:`pip`.

----------
Pip
----------
  .. code-block:: console

      $ pip install kilopop

  Supported python versions: 3.9+.


This will install all python requirements for running :code:`kilopop`


-------------------------------------
Install :code:`kilopop` from source
-------------------------------------

:code:`kilopop` is developed and tested with Python 3.9+. In the
following, we assume you have a working python installation, `python pip
<https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#use-pip-for-installing>`_,
and `git <https://git-scm.com/>`_.

The FORTRAN Dependencies above still need to be installed, but the installation can then be done as follows:

Clone the repository, install the requirements, and then install the software:

.. code-block:: console

   $ git clone https://github.com/cnsetzer/kilopop
   $ cd kilopop
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   $ pip install .
